                            <p>
                                var, let, and const are JavaScript variable declaration keywords with different scopes
                                and behaviors.

                            </p>
                            <p>var: Has function-level scope, allowing it to be accessed anywhere within the function
                                in which it's declared. It's also hoisted, meaning it's moved to the top of its scope
                                during execution.</p>
                            <p> let: Has block-level scope, making it accessible only within the block (e.g., within
                                loops or conditional statements) where it's defined. It's also not hoisted, so it must
                                be declared before use.</p>
                            <p>const: Also has block-level scope but is used for constants that cannot be reassigned
                                after declaration. Like let, it's not hoisted and must be initialized when declared.</p>

                            <h2 class="card-title">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h2>
                            <p>Null and undefined are used in JavaScript to represent missing or empty values. Null is
                                explicitly assigned to a variable to indicate the absence of a value. Undefined
                                typically occurs when a variable is declared but not initialized. Use cases include
                                error handling, checking if a value exists, and initializing variables.</p>

                            <p>REST (Representational State Transfer) API is an architectural style for designing
                                networked applications. It uses a set of constraints to create a lightweight and
                                scalable web service. REST APIs use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to
                                perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources, represented as
                                URLs. They follow the client-server model, are stateless, and support caching. REST APIs
                                are widely used for building web services that allow different systems to communicate
                                and share data over the internet in a simple and standardized way, making them a
                                fundamental part of web development.</p>
